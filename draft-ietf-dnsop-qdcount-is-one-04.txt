Abstract

   This document updates RFC 1035 by constraining the allowed value of
   the QDCOUNT parameter in DNS messages with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) to a
   maximum of one, and specifies the required behaviour when values that
   are not allowed are encountered.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol [RFC1034][RFC1035] includes a parameter QDCOUNT in
   the DNS message header, whose value is specified to mean the number
   of questions in the Question Section of a DNS message.

   In a general sense it seems perfectly plausible for the QDCOUNT
   parameter, an unsigned 16-bit value, to take a considerable range of
   values.  However, in the specific case of messages that encode DNS
   queries and responses (messages with OPCODE = 0) there are other
   limitations inherent in the protocol that constrain values of QDCOUNT
   to be either 0 or 1.  In particular, several parameters specified for
   DNS response messages such as AA and RCODE have no defined meaning
   when the message contains multiple queries, since there is no way to
   signal which question those parameters relate to.

   In this document we briefly survey the existing written DNS
   specification; we provide a description of the semantic and practical
   requirements for DNS queries that naturally constrain the allowable
   values of QDCOUNT; and we update the DNS base specification to
   clarify the allowable values of the QDCODE parameter in the specific
   case of DNS messages with OPCODE = 0.

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  QDCOUNT is (usually) One

   A brief summary of the guidance provided in the existing DNS
   specification ([RFC1035] and many other documents) for the use of
   QDCOUNT can be found in Appendix A.  While the specification is clear
   in many cases, in the specific case of OPCODE = 0 there is some
   ambiguity which this document aims to eliminate.

4.  Updates to RFC 1035

   A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT include a QDCOUNT parameter
   whose value is greater than 1.  It follows that the Question
   Section of a DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT contain more than
   one question.

   A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT > 1 MUST be treated as an
   incorrectly-formatted message.  The value of the RCODE parameter in
   the response message MUST be set to 1 (FORMERR).

   Middleboxes (e.g. firewalls) that process DNS messages in order to
   eliminate unwanted traffic SHOULD treat messages with OPCODE = 0 and
   QDCOUNT > 1 as malformed traffic and return a FORMERR response as
   described above.  Such firewalls MUST NOT treat messages with OPCODE
   = 0 and QDCOUNT = 0 as malformed.  See Section 4 of [RFC8906] for
   further guidance.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies the DNS specification and aims to improve
   interoperability between different DNS implementations.  In general,
   the elimination of ambiguity seems well-aligned with security
   hygiene.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Guidance for the use of QDCOUNT in the DNS Specification

   The DNS Specification provides some guidance about the values of
   QDCOUNT that are appropriate in various situations.  A brief summary
   of this guidance is collated below.

A.1.  OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and 1 (IQUERY)

   [RFC1035] significantly predates the use of the normative
   requirements keywords specified in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174], and
   parts of it are consequently somewhat open to interpretation.

   Section 4.1.2 ("Question section format") has this to say about
   QDCOUNT:

      The section contains QDCOUNT (usually 1) entries

   The only documented exceptions within [RFC1035] relate to the IQuery
   Opcode, where the request has "an empty question section" (QDCOUNT =
   0), and the response has "zero, one, or multiple domain names for the
   specified resource as QNAMEs in the question section".  The IQuery
   OpCode was made obsolete in [RFC3425].

   In the absence of clearly expressed normative requirements, we rely
   on other text in [RFC1035] that makes use of the definite article or
   other text that implies a singular question and, by implication,
   QDCOUNT = 1.

   For example, Section 4.1:

      the question for the name server

   and:

Internet-Draft    In the DNS, QDCOUNT is (usually) One         June 2024


      The question section contains fields that describe a question to a
      name server

   and in Section 4.1.1.  ("Header section format"):

      AA Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses, and
      specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the
      domain name in question section.

   DNS Cookies [RFC7873] in Section 5.4 allow a client to receive a
   valid Server Cookie without sending a specific question by sending a
   request (QR = 0) with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT = 0, with the resulting
   response also containing no question.

   DNS Zone Transfer Protocol (AXFR) [RFC5936] in Section 2.2 allows an
   authoritative server optionally to send a response message (QR = 1)
   to a standard AXFR query (OPCODE = 0, QTYPE=252) with QDCOUNT = 0 in
   the second or subsequent message of a multi-message response.

A.2.  OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY)

   DNS Notify [RFC1996] also lacks a clearly defined range of values for
   QDCOUNT.  Section 3.7 says:

      A NOTIFY request has QDCOUNT > 0

   but all other text in the RFC talks about the <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE>
   tuple in the singular.

A.3.  OPCODE = 5 (UPDATE)

   DNS Update [RFC2136] renames the QDCOUNT field to ZOCOUNT, but the
   value is constrained to be one by Section 2.3 ("Zone Section"):

      All records to be updated must be in the same zone, and therefore
      the Zone Section is allowed to contain exactly one record.

A.4.  OPCODE = 6 (DNS Stateful Operations, DSO)

   DNS Stateful Operations [RFC8490] (DSO - OpCode 6) attempts to
   preserve compatibility with the standard DNS 12 octet header, and
   does so by requiring that all four of the section count values be set
   to zero.

A.5.  Conclusion

   There is no text in [RFC1035] that describes how other parameters in
   the DNS message such as AA, RCODE should be interpreted in the case
   where a message includes more than one question.  An originator of a
   query with QDCOUNT > 1 can have no expectations of how it will be
   processed, and the receiver of a response with QDCOUNT > 1 has no
   guidance for how it should be interpreted.

   The allowable values of QDCOUNT seem to be clearly specified for
   OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY), OPCODE = 5 (UPDATE) and OPCODE = 6 (DNS Stateful
   Operations, DSO).  OPCODE = 1 (IQUERY) is obsolete and OPCODE = 2
   (STATUS) is not specified.  OPCODE = 3 is reserved.

   However, the allowable values of QDCOUNT for OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) are
   specified in [RFC1035] without the clarity of normative language, and
   this looseness of language results in some ambiguity.
