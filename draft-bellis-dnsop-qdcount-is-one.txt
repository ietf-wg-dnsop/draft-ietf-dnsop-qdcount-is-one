1.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol [RFC1034][RFC1035] includes a parameter QDCOUNT in
   the DNS message header, whose value is specified to mean the number
   of questions in the Question Section of a message.

   In a general sense it seems perfectly plausible for the QDCOUNT
   parameter, an unsigned 16-bit value, to take a considerable range of
   values.  However, in the specific case of messages that encode DNS
   queries and responses (messages with OPCODE = 0) there are other
   limitations inherent in the protocol that constrain values of QDCOUNT
   to be either 0 or 1.  In particular, several parameters specified for
   DNS response messages such as AA and RCODE have no defined meaning
   when the message contains multiple queries, since there is no way to
   signal which question those parameters relate to.

   In this document we briefly survey the existing written DNS
   specification; we provide a description of the semantic and practical
   requirements for DNS queries that naturally constrain the allowable
   values of QDCOUNT; and we update the DNS base specification to
   clarify the allowable values of the QDCODE parameter in the specific
   case of DNS messages with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY).

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  QDCOUNT is (usually) One

   A brief summary of the guidance provided in the existing DNS
   specification for the use of QDCOUNT can be found in Appendix A.
   While the specification is clear in many cases, in the specific case
   of OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) there is some ambiguity which this document
   aims to eliminate.

4.  Updates to RFC 1035

   A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) MUST NOT include a QDCOUNT
   parameter whose value is greater than 1.  It follows that the
   Question Section of a DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT contain
   more than one question.

   A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and QDCOUNT > 1 MUST be treated
   as an incorrectly-formatted message.  The value of the RCODE
   parameter in the response message MUST be set to 1 (FORMERR).

   Firewalls that process DNS messages in order to eliminate unwanted
   traffic SHOULD treat messages with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT > 1 as
   malformed traffic.  See Section 4 of [RFC8906] for further guidance.
   Such firewalls MUST NOT treat messages with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT =
   0 as malformed.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies the DNS specification and aims to improve
   interoperability between different DNS implementations.  In general,
   the elimination of ambiguity seems well-aligned with security
   hygiene.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Guidance for the use of QDCOUNT in the DNS Specification

   The DNS Specification provides some guidance about the values of
   QDCOUNT that are appropriate in various situations.  A brief summary
   of this guidance is collated below.

A.1.  OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and 1 (IQUERY)

   [RFC1035] significantly predates the use of normative requirements
   keywords, and parts of it are consequently somewhat open to
   interpretation.

   Section 4.1.2 ("Question section format") has this to say about
   QDCOUNT:

      The section contains QDCOUNT (usually 1) entries

   The only documented exceptions within [RFC1035] relate to the IQuery
   Opcode, where the request has "an empty question section" (QDCOUNT =
   0), and "zero, one, or multiple domain names for the specified
   resource as QNAMEs in the question section".  The IQuery OpCode was
   made obsolete in [RFC3425].

   In the absence of clearly expressed normative requirements, we rely
   on other text in [RFC1035] that makes use of the definite article or
   other text that implies a singular question and, by implication,
   QDCOUNT = 1.

   For example, Section 4.1:

      the question for the name server

   and:

      The question section contains fields that describe a question to a
      name server

   and in Section 4.1.1.  ("Header section format"):

      AA Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses, and
      specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the
      domain name in question section.

   DNS Cookies [RFC7873] in Section 5.4 allow a client to receive a
   valid Server Cookie without sending a specific question by sending a
   Query packet (OpCode 0) with QDCOUNT = 0, with the resulting response
   also containing no question.

A.2.  OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY)

   DNS Notify [RFC1996] also lacks a clearly defined range of values for
   QDCOUNT.  Section 3.7 says:

      A NOTIFY request has QDCOUNT > 0

   but all other text in the RFC talks about the <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE>
   tuple in the singular.

A.3.  OPCODE = 5 (UPDATE)

   DNS Update [RFC2136] renames the QDCOUNT field to ZOCOUNT, but the
   value is constrained to be one by Section 2.3 ("Zone Section"):

      All records to be updated must be in the same zone, and therefore
      the Zone Section is allowed to contain exactly one record.

A.4.  OPCODE = 6 (DNS Stateful Operations, DSO)

   DNS Stateful Operations [RFC8490] (DSO - OpCode 6) attempts to
   preserve compatibility with the standard DNS 12 octet header, and
   does so by requiring that all four of the section count values be set
   to zero.

A.5.  Conclusion

   There is no text in [RFC1035] that describes how other parameters in
   the DNS message such as AA, RCODE should be interpreted in the case
   where a message includes more than one question.  An originator of a
   query with QDCOUNT > 1 can have no expectations of how it will be
   processed, and the receiver of a response with QDCOUNT > 1 has no
   guidance for how it should be interpreted.

   The allowable values of QDCOUNT seem to be clearly specified for
   OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY), OPCODE = 5 (UPDATE) and OPCODE = 6 (DNS Stateful
   Operations, DSO).  OPCODE = 1 (IQUERY) is obsolete and OPCODE = 2
   (STATUS) is not specified.  OPCODE = 3 is reserved.

   However, the allowable values of QDCOUNT for OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) are
   specified in [RFC1035] without the clarity of normative language, and
   this looseness of language results in some ambiguity.
